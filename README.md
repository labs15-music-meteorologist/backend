# Music Meteorologist Frontend

Frontend Deployment (Coming Soon)
Release v1.0

[Visit Backend](https://music-meteorology-development.herokuapp.com/) (See endpoints below)

Music Meteorologist is a fullstack web application that has been built during the Labs15 (1st August 2019 - 30 September 2019) by
[LambdaSchool](https://lambdaschool.com/) students. Each student fulfills a role in the project to collectively build the application. (Roles listed below)

Music Meteorologist provides a web application where users can play a guessing game and get to know themself better. A sophisticated Machine Learning model will try to predict better than the user itself if a certain music song will be liked or not. For that a lot of different characteristics of a songs are considered. At the end the user can revisit the assessment of the model and give feedback about its correctness. To deliver this experience a Node.JS Backend and a React.JS Frontend were built.

## Built With

- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - Language used to make the webpage interactive
- [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - JavaScript runtime for executing JavaScript at the server outside the browser
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Lightweight web framework to bootstrap Node.js APIs
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - An advanced object-relational database for production environments
- [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) - A SQL query builder that helps abstracting migrations and DDLs for different database types into a single coherent structure
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - JSON Web Token for authorization and client side tokens for security
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) - Lightweight module to handle dates and times
- [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) - A test module for HTTP assertions
- [JEST](https://jestjs.io/) - Simple JavaScript testing framework

#### Middleware

Middleware is divided into 2 different types:

- Middleware that restricts access to certain routes for authorization :x: (Soon)
- Middleware that validates request body payloads :heavy_check_mark:

Whenever for a route a certain ID or Resource object like a user is required these routes are protected by validation middleware and returning generic responses when used by badly shaped requests. Thus every endpoint documented has a indication of what generic validation responses it will provide when used incorrectly.

Authorization is handled through Java Web Token (JWT). A token authorizes a user to access JWT protected routes for 1 hour until it a relogin needs to happen.

To submit a JWT along a HTTP request add the JWT that can be acquired through the unprotected login route and then set it as "Authorization" "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoxMSwiZW1haWwiOiJrZXZpbkB0ZXN0LmNvbTY2NiIsImlhdCI6MTU2NDY4MzgzMiwiZXhwIjoxNTY0Njg3NDMyfQ.t3LhcZ5VppqZMSPL4LAWcllEqKzI9nTZ8VNseMZzoVE" as a Header for the request.

The JWT is randomly generated and only the specific provided one from login will be valid.

<span style="color:red">Bad Authorization Response (401 UNAUTHORIZED)</span>:

```
{
    "warning": "Authorization failed. Access denied!"
}
```

<span style="color:red">User validation no body data (400 BAD REQUEST)</span>:

```
{
    "warning": "Missing user data entirely."
}
```

<span style="color:red">User validation user data not complete (400 BAD REQUEST)</span>:

```
{
    "warning": "Missing required email or spotify_user_id or user_spotify_api_key or date_of_birth or spotify_product_type or display_name or country information for an user."
}
```

<span style="color:red">User ID validation user not found (404 NOT FOUND)</span>:

```
{
    "info": "The user with the id 3 was not found during validation."
}
```

<span style="color:red">User ID validation server error (500 SERVER ERROR)</span>:

```
{
    "error": "An error occurred during validation of the user."
}
```

#### JSON Responses

For JSON responses there are 4 different content types available:

- A JSON containing a direct resource **{ "id": 1, "email": "test@test.com" }** or a JSON containing a resource **{ "resource": [{"id": 1, "email": "test@test.com"}, {"id": 2, "email": "test2@test.com"}] }** or a JSON containing a message string **{ "message": "text" }** means that the request was successful and data is returned to the client. So the request **happened**.
- A JSON containing a { "**info**" : "text" } means that the request was semantically not useful as for example a deletion of no elements or search for no existing user. It **happened** but was useless.
- A JSON containing a { "**warning**": "text"} means that something went wrong because of how the request was shaped and it **did not happen**.
- A JSON containing a { "**error**" : "text" } means that something went wrong internally during the request and it **did not happen**.

#### HTTP Status Codes

Next to the custom JSON response system also [HTTP Status Codes](https://http.cat/) were used.

## Installation

### Local PostgreSQL Installation

Download and install the correct [Installation Package](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) for your OS.

During installation set a master password and keep it safe.

Start the PostgreSQL Shell (PSQL) and press multiple times enter until password is prompted. The password was set during the installation of PostgreSQL.

Create a new user by inserting this command and use a password of your choosing. Don't forget about the closing ; otherwise the command is incorrect.

```

CREATE ROLE music WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'iamanunsecurepassword';

```

Set the newly created user to a superuser by inserting this command.

```

ALTER ROLE music superuser createrole createdb replication bypassrls;

```

Create a new database that can be used for the local development installation of the music meteorologist application. For that open pgadmin4, uncollapse servers, select a existing server and rightlick to create a new database.

The new database could be named music_dev for example. Make sure to use that name in the .env file as environment variable.

Rightclick on the database and click on Properties to assign a user to the database. Make sure to select the newly "music" user as the owner of the database.

### Environment Variables

This application makes usage of environment variable to set the PORT the server listens on, to connect to the database and to let the application know in which environment it currently runs so it can behave accordingly.

On Heroku the Config Vars accepted configurations are:

```

DATABASE_URL=provided postgres connectioN URI
PORT=5000
DB_ENV=development OR deployedDevelopment OR staging1 OR staging2 or production
SERVER_URL=https://music-meteorology-development.herokuapp.com/ or https://music-meteorology-production.herokuapp.com/ or https://music-meteorology-staging1.herokuapp.com/ or https://music-meteorology-staging2.herokuapp.com/
DEPLOYMENT=development or production or staging1 or staging2
```

For a local installation and connection to a local PostgreSQL database accepted environmental variables are:

.env file

```
PORT=5000
DATABASE_DB=your_postgres_database_name
DATABASE_USER=your_postgres_database_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_postgres_database_password
DB_ENV=development
SERVER_URL=localhost
DEPLOYMENT=localhost
```

### Installing the Application

This application required a installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to make JavaScript executable on the server side.

You can check with node -v in the terminal if Node.js was installed and which version you got.

Simply run this command in terminal on the folder level where package.json is located.

```

npm i

```

Now a package.lock and node_modules folder should be present containing all external modules and dependencies to start up the application.

To start the application simply run this command in command line on the same folder level where package.json is located.

```

npm run server

```

To start the server in on a remote server like Heroku a different start command is used:

```

npm start

```

## Testing

Tests for the Backend are beeing handled through the npm module supertest. To run the tests use the following start script:

```
npm run test
```

## Reporting / Logging

For reporting of applications errors [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is used. A new route that will always throw an error was established called:

```
https://music-meteorology-production.herokuapp.com/debug-sentry
https://music-meteorology-development.herokuapp.com/debug-sentry
https://music-meteorology-staging1.herokuapp.com/debug-sentry
https://music-meteorology-staging2.herokuapp.com/debug-sentry
```

Bugs with sentry are visible within the dashboard and can be intraged into a Slack channel.

## Architecture and Workflow

![](documentation/database-schema.png)

The application is split into two tables. One User can have many taste_profiles. One taste_profile can have one user. This is because a user can like different kind of music like Metallica and Frank Sinatra at the same time. By capturing different tastes a more complete image of the users musical taste can be delivering to the datascience model

For the Backend Node.JS with Express.JS was used to bootstrap the server and thus the endpoints. For the database in development, staging1, staging2 and production environment locally and remotely PostgreSQL was used. For authorization and restriction of endpoints JWT between the Frontend client and the Backend was used. The deployment was made on Heroku where the environmental variables are configured and tweaks via Heroku Cli were made to execute knex migrations and seeds.

For testing of the server and endpoints supertest and JEST was used.
